## 1. Current Assessment

### ✅ What's Done Well

| Document | Strengths |
|----------|----------|
| **Environment Setup Guide.md** | Detailed steps, covering Windows/Linux/macOS, comprehensive troubleshooting |
| **CI Platform Configuration Guide.md** | Truly "hands-on", step-by-step screenshot-style instructions |
| **Documentation Index.md** | Clear learning path classification (A/B/C/D/E paths) |
| **FAQ and Troubleshooting.md** | Comprehensive high-frequency questions, clear resolution approaches |
| **Developer Getting Started Guide.md** | Complete daily development flow, practical checklists |

### ⚠️ Areas Needing Improvement

| Issue Type | Specific Manifestations | Impact |
|------------|------------------------|--------|
| **Missing quick start guide** | No "see results in 5 minutes" path | Newcomers may give up during environment setup |
| **Insufficient visual content** | Almost all text, lacking architecture diagrams, flowcharts | Abstract concepts hard to understand |
| **Prerequisites scattered** | Python/West/CMake version requirements spread across multiple docs | Newcomers don't know what to install first |
| **Windows pain points scattered** | PowerShell policy, path format issues scattered everywhere | High frustration rate for Windows users |
| **Missing "first LED" tutorial** | No complete example from zero to hardware control | After learning, don't know how to control hardware |
| **Terminology explanations not accessible** | Terms like "standalone app", "Devicetree overlay" lack one-sentence explanations | High barrier to entry for newcomers |
| **Missing video/animation** | Key steps have no visual reference | Operational steps hard to replicate |

### 3. **Documentation Index.md** Improvement Suggestions

**Current issues**:
- Learning paths clear but missing "estimated time"
- Newcomers don't know how long each path takes

**Improvement suggestions**:
```diff
  ### Path A: First Compile This Project (Zero Basics)

  0. (If **copying this repository as a new project**) First read **[README.md](../../../README.md)** "Initialize New Project from Template (Checklist)" and **[Developer Getting Started Guide.md](../00-Getting-Started/04-Developer-Getting-Started.md#post-template-copy-checklist)**, complete alignment of west, CMake, CI board, etc.
  1. **[Environment Setup Guide.md](../10-Environment/11-Environment-Setup-Guide.md)** — Install Zephyr SDK, West, CMake, Python; configure **`zephyr_config.env`**; verify **`west build`** passes.
+    ⏱️ Estimated time: 1-2 hours first time (including downloads), 10 minutes thereafter
+
  2. **[Standalone App Build Guide.md](../10-Environment/12-Standalone-App-Build-Guide.md)** — Understand "standalone app" directory structure, **`ZEPHYR_BASE`**, common **`west build`** parameters; custom board and overlay conventions.
+    ⏱️ Estimated time: 30 minutes
+
  3. If **changing development board**: **[Board Migration Guide.md](../10-Environment/13-Board-Migration-Guide.md)** — Complete board migration process, device tree adjustment, memory configuration, CI updates.
+    ⏱️ Estimated time: 1 hour (first time)
+
  4. **[Developer Getting Started Guide.md](../00-Getting-Started/04-Developer-Getting-Started.md)** — Project directory, `prj.conf` / `Kconfig` division of responsibilities, shortest flow for adding modules and events.
+    ⏱️ Estimated time: 1 hour
```

**Priority**: 🟢 Low (but thoughtful)

---

### 4. **FAQ and Troubleshooting.md** Improvement Suggestions

**Current issues**:
- Missing "error message → possible cause → solution" quick index
- Windows-specific issues not prominent enough

**Improvement suggestions**:
```diff
+ ## Quick Index (by Error Message)
+
+ | Error Message | Possible Cause | Solution |
+ |---------------|----------------|----------|
+ | `ZEPHYR_BASE not set` | Environment variable not configured | [Link](#11-zephyr_base_not_set) |
+ | `region RAM overflowed` | Insufficient memory | [Link](#21-region-ram-overflowed) |
+ | `'west' is not recognized` | Not installed or venv not activated | [Link](#12-west-not-found-in-terminal) |
+ | `Board 'xxx' not found` | Board not recognized | [Link](#23-board-xxx-not-found) |
+
  ## 1. Environment and Paths

    end

    App --> Modules
    Modules --> Events
    Modules --> IPC
    Events --> Zephyr
